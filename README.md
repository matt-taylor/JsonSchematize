# JsonSchematize

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be
able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file
`lib/json_schematize`. To experiment with that code, run
`bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment. Run `bundle exec json_schematize` to use
the gem in this directory, ignoring other installed copies of this gem.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

To release a new version:

1. Update the version number in [lib/json_schematize/version.rb]
2. Update [CHANGELOG.md]
3. Merge to the main branch. This will trigger an automatic build in CircleCI
   and push the new gem to the repo.
